Windows 10

If you do have the Installation Media :

    Insert the Media (DVD/USB) in your PC and restart.

    Boot from the media.

    Select Repair Your Computer.

    Select Troubleshoot.

    Select Advanced Options.

    Choose Command Prompt from the menu :

        Type and run the command :

        diskpart

        Type and run the command :

        sel disk 0

        Type and run the command :

        list vol

    Verify that the EFI partition (EPS - EFI System Partition) is using the FAT32 file system and assign a drive letter to it (Assign a letter that isn't already in use.):

        Type and run the command :

        sel vol <number of volume>

        Type and run the command :

        assign letter=<drive letter>:

        Type and run the command :

        exit

    In order to repair the boot record :

        Type and run the command :

        cd /d <drive letter>:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\

        Type and run the command :

        bootrec /FixBoot

If you don't have the Installation Media :

    Restart your PC

    Tap rapidly on the <F8> key once the PC has turned on, but before the Windows Splash Screen appears.

    Please be aware this may take several attempts. The timing for this option was shortened significantly from that in Windows 7.

    Select Repair your computer from the menu that appears.

    Select Command Prompt from the Advanced Options tab in the Troubleshoot screen :

        Type and run the command :

        diskpart

        Type and run the command :

        sel disk 0

        Type and run the command :

        list vol

    Verify that the EFI partition (EPS - EFI System Partition) is using the FAT32 file system and assign a drive letter to it (Assign a letter that isn't already in use.):

        Type and run the command :

        sel vol <number of volume>

        Type and run the command :

        assign letter=<drive letter>:

        Type and run the command :

        exit

    In order to repair the boot record :

        Type and run the command :

        cd /d <drive letter>:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\

        Type and run the command :

        bootrec /FixBoot

The next step is the same across all the operating systems at this point :

    Rebuild the BCD store

    First run the command below to backup the old BCD :

    ren BCD BCD.old

    Now recreate it using this command :

    bcdboot c:\Windows /l en-us /s <boot letter>: All

Note: If you are creating boot entries on an attached USB Flash or other external drive add /f between the : and the ALL. Please remember that the <boot letter> is replaced with whatever the letter of the drive you are booting from is. (ie. C:\, D:\)
